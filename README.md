## Arduino_Weather_API_Display
Arduino based project which makes calls to a weather API to get weather information about location of the arduino based off of the IP Address of the WiFi network it is connected to.

## Motivation
I want a little weather station screen that I can set on my desk to always be able to see the weather. I am also still very intermediate in my Arduino skills, and this project is a good way to continue my learning progress.

## Status
Early WIP

## Code Style

## Pictures
When the project is completed, there will be images of the wiring and final casing of the project posted here.

## Framework Used
[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)

## Features
Most Arduino weather stations rely on physical sensors, but this project seeks to take the extra step and pull the statistics from a REST API rather than physical sensors for a more accurate reading that is not dependent upon the sensor's location.

## Credits
I am using some outside libraries, but I am not sure which ones will be permanent in the project yet, so this will be updated as the project comes closer to completion.
